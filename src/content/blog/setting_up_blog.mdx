### Introduction

I had previously written my [website](https://github.com/rkaahean/rkaahean.github.io) using NextJS. There were a few drawbacks
to this -

- **Lack of proper MDX support** : At the time of writing, NextJS (13.4.10) had only experimental support for MDX.

```typescript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    mdxRs: true,
  },
};

const withMDX = require("@next/mdx")();
module.exports = withMDX(nextConfig);
```

I had heard great things about Astro, and the docs were a lot more oriented towards hosting / managing content.

### Setup

#### 1. Getting Start

The first step is setting up an Astro project - with `npm create astro@latest`. Reading about the project structure [was also helpful](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/project-structure/).
