AI is great. There are a dozen blog posts covering them. This isn't one of them. What nobody tells you is how frustrating it can be.

<br/>

I was recently working on a ffmpeg related project at work, and tried out the latest Gemini 2.5 model. It is _really_ verbose. Like adding a comment for every line of code verbose. 
Even after asking the model to cut it out and keep it concise, it refused. But thats not even the worst part.

<br/>

These AI models disillusion you with the sense of a solution. They pretend as if they have the answer, and with a few more prompts, you would have solved the exact problem, and can just straight
up copy paste. But what actually happens is
<br/>

1. You ask it for code
2. It gives you code that doesn't compile
3. You fix errors so that it compiles
4. It doesn't do what you asked for. But _it seems_ close.
5. Go back to step #1

<br/>

What actually really sucks about this is _how much_ time you waste doing things that isn't even relevant to your original problem. At best, you spend 5-10 minutes in one loop, and at worst, you
encounter another completely unrelated issue. And you know where you get the solution? The goddammit AI again.
<br/>

I wasted ~2 hours trying to get Gemini give me the answer. How i fixed it in the end? A bit of stack overflow magic, and some personal intuition. The feeling is magical - only to realise that you
did not need AI for this AT ALL. Not only did you waste 2 hours, you absolutely _kill_ all the momentum you have.
<br/>

I'm not saying you should abandon AI, but if you really care about "getting gud" you should 
- disable any in-editor AI. copilot. cursor. whatever. They take over your thinking, and you end up solving a problem that you didn't even need to solve.
- default to stackoverflow. If you have an issue, go there. It has worked for others, it should work for you.
- use AI as a means of brainstorming. Don't ask if for the code. Ask it for an approach. Validate it with stackoverflow.
- timebox it. Don't run into rabbit holes and dead ends. Make sure you're controlling the AI, and not the other way around.
<br/>

I still believe that using AI is a net positive, but proceed with caution.
