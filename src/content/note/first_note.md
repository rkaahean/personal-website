description: Experimenting with a different format
---

I've tried various avenues of blogging over the years. On [medium](https://medium.com/@rkaahean). On my [website](https://ranjan.dev/blog/setting_up_blog). On [twitter](https://ranjan.dev/blog/setting_up_blog). On [substack](https://ranjansrinivas.substack.com/). \
\
But I've failed to write consistently. Instead of trying a different platform, I have to consider the idea that blogging isn't for me - at least not in the current format. I've seen a few other folks do this, but having a "notes" section, where I can write semi-edited thoughts might be a good balance. \
\
Unlike twitter, nobody needs to see it. Unlike a blog, there's no specific goal. I'm hoping to reduce the friction between wanting to write about something vs wanting the it to be perfect. \
\
"Notes" will not, and that's the point.
